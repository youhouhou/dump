Here are several scenarios, categorized by the key "agent-like" feature they highlight:

I. Scenarios Highlighting Dynamic Risk Assessment:

Scenario 1: "The High-Value First Purchase."

Context: A new user (riskProfile initially "medium" or even unknown) makes a relatively large purchase (e.g., price * quantity exceeds a predefined threshold).
Agent Action: The risk assessment component calculates a high risk score.
Demonstration:
Show the risk score calculation (e.g., print it to the console).
The agent triggers additional verification: Instead of directly processing, it simulates sending a request for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to the upstream agent (you can just print a message like "Requesting 2FA from user").
If 2FA (simulated) is successful, the payment proceeds. If not, it's rejected.
Agent Advantage: Shows dynamic adaptation to risk, going beyond a simple "allow/deny" based on a fixed threshold.
Scenario 2: "The Unusual Location."

Context: A user with a history of purchases from one location (e.g., based on a hardcoded "usual location" in their profile) suddenly makes a purchase with a shipping address in a very different location.
Agent Action: The risk assessment flags the location discrepancy, increasing the risk score.
Demonstration:
Show the risk score increasing due to the location difference.
The agent might trigger a request for additional verification (e.g., "Confirm shipping address") or even simulate contacting the user via email/SMS (again, just print a message).
Agent Advantage: Demonstrates context-aware risk assessment, considering factors beyond just the transaction amount.
Scenario 3: "The Rapid Purchases."

Context: A user makes several purchases in rapid succession within a short timeframe.
Agent Action: The agent detects the high frequency of transactions and increases the risk score.
Demonstration:
Show a "transaction history" (a simple list) for the simulated user.
The agent might delay the later transactions slightly (simulated delay) or request additional verification.
Agent Advantage: Highlights the ability to adapt to changing patterns of behavior.
II. Scenarios Highlighting Adaptive Payment Method Selection:

Scenario 4: "The Preferred Method Failure."

Context: A user's preferred payment method (e.g., PayPal balance) has insufficient funds.
Agent Action:
The agent detects the failure.
Instead of rejecting, it checks for alternative linked payment methods (e.g., a linked credit card).
If an alternative is found, it simulates suggesting it to the user (via the upstream agent â€“ a printed message like "PayPal balance insufficient. Use credit card ending in 1234?").
If the user (simulated) accepts, the agent processes the payment with the alternative method.
Demonstration: Clearly show the flow: preferred method fails -> alternative suggested -> payment successful with the alternative.
Agent Advantage: Demonstrates adaptability and a user-friendly approach to payment failures.
Scenario 5: "The Restricted Payment Method."

Context: A user attempts to use a payment method that is restricted for the particular product or transaction type (you can simulate this with a simple rule, e.g., "Product X cannot be purchased with credit cards").
Agent Action:
The agent detects the restriction.
It informs the user (simulated message) about the restriction and suggests alternative payment methods.
Demonstration: Show the agent enforcing a business rule and guiding the user towards acceptable payment options.
Agent Advantage: Illustrates policy enforcement and proactive user guidance.
III. Scenarios Highlighting Asynchronous Communication:

Scenario 6: "The Delayed Fraud Check."

Context: A transaction is initially processed (payment authorized).
Agent Action:
The payment agent initiates the payment.
Simultaneously, it sends a request to a (simulated) "fraud detection service" (this could just be a separate function that waits for a few seconds and then returns a result).
After a delay (simulating the fraud check), the "fraud detection service" returns a result (e.g., "flagged" or "clear").
If flagged, the payment agent simulates reversing the transaction and notifying the user (again, with printed messages).
Demonstration: Show the asynchronous flow: payment happens before the fraud check completes. This is crucial for a good user experience (not making the user wait for lengthy fraud checks).
Agent Advantage: Demonstrates event-driven behavior and handling of asynchronous events. This is very different from a simple sequential pipeline.
Scenario 7: "Shipping Label generation request from seller"

Context: After the payment is done, and the seller wants to use paypal to generate shipping label
Agent Action:
the payment agent recieves request from "seller agent"(simulated)
generate(simulated) the shipping label, and send to "seller agent"
Demonstration: Shows the asynchronous flow: payment happens before the label request.
Agent Advantage: Demonstrates inter-agent communication.
IV. Scenario Combining Multiple Features (More Advanced):

Scenario 8: "The High-Risk, Alternative Payment Success."
Context: Combines elements of Scenarios 1 and 4. A new user makes a high-value purchase, their preferred payment method fails, and the transaction is flagged as high-risk.
Agent Action:
Risk assessment flags the transaction.
Preferred payment method fails.
The agent suggests an alternative payment method but also requires additional verification (e.g., 2FA) due to the high risk.
Demonstration: Showcases the agent making multiple decisions and adapting to a complex situation.
Agent Advantage: A strong demonstration of the benefits of an agent-based approach over a simple pipeline.
Choosing Scenarios for Your PoC:

Pick 2-3 scenarios that best demonstrate the agent-like qualities you want to highlight. Don't try to do all of them.
Scenario 1 ("High-Value First Purchase") and Scenario 4 ("Preferred Method Failure") are good starting points, as they are relatively easy to implement and clearly show agent behavior.
Scenario 6 ("Delayed Fraud Check") is excellent for demonstrating asynchronous capabilities.
Scenario 8 ("High-Risk, Alternative Payment Success") is a good choice if you want to show a more complex, multi-faceted agent.
Consider the narrative flow when you're demonstrating. How will you explain what's happening and why it's significant?
