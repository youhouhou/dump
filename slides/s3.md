Crucially, there's no explicit feature for broad intent-level disambiguation.  What we have is primarily intent confirmation based on the intent model's confidence. For example, if the system is somewhat sure about 'Refund Status,' it might just ask, 'Okay, so you want to check the status refund?'  It's not offering alternatives if the initial guess is off.

Any task-specific clarification logic – like asking for a transaction ID for a refund – is currently embedded within each individual self-service flow based on predefined business logic.
