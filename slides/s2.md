"On this slide, we dive into the Typology of Ambiguity we encounter in PPA and the strategies we're considering.

First, let's establish our Generic Disambiguation Stepsâ€”a high-level framework for how the system will handle potential ambiguity. (Point to "Detect Ambiguity -> Clarify / Handle -> Fallback" flow)

- Detect Ambiguity: The first crucial step is to identify if a query is ambiguous. A key principle here is that high precision is crucial. We want to avoid interrupting the user unnecessarily, as that can also be frustrating.

- Clarify / Handle: If ambiguity is detected, the system will then employ tailored clarification questions. We need to prioritize the user experience by making these questions clear, empathetic, and keeping the interaction efficient. Importantly, the strategy here adapts based on the specific type of ambiguity detected.

- Fallback: If clarification isn't successful, we need a graceful degradation path. This typically involves options like transferring to a human agent with full context or offering alternative help.

Now, let's focus on the Tailored Clarification Strategies for the two most significant ambiguity types we see in PPA, which often occur in a logical sequence. (Point to the table)

The first challenge we often encounter is when the 'User Intent Unclear' (accounting for 41% of ambiguities).

This happens when a user's query is vague about their overall goal. For example, they might just say &lt;span class="code-like">"dispute"&lt;/span> or &lt;span class="code-like">"account help."&lt;/span>
At this stage, our strategy is to 'Offer Intent Options.'
To do this effectively, the key dependency for the LLM is access to a comprehensive 'PayPal Intent Taxonomy' with user-friendly descriptions for each potential intent.
A sample clarification question would be something like, "Are you trying to check payment status, update your account settings, or perhaps report an issue with a transaction?"
From a System Integration perspective, this intent-level clarification happens &lt;span class="highlight-text">early in the system flow, close to the initial user input&lt;/span>. The LLM system uses its knowledge of the &lt;span class="knowledge-type">intent taxonomy&lt;/span> to generate relevant choices. RAG can optionally help by providing richer descriptions for more complex intent options. This initial clarification can be managed by a &lt;span class="highlight-text">standalone disambiguation module&lt;/span> or logic integrated early in the dialogue flow.
Once we have a clearer idea of the user's general intent, we then often face the most common type of ambiguity: 'Lack of Specific Details' (making up 52% of cases).

This occurs when the intent is somewhat clear, but critical information needed to actually perform the task is missing. For instance, after a user clarifies they want to check their "refund status."
Here, our strategy shifts to 'Prompt for Missing Parameters.'
The key dependency is now domain-specific knowledge of the required entities or slots for that now partially clarified intent.
So, a sample clarification question would be, "Okay, I can help with the refund status. To proceed, please provide the transaction ID."
In terms of System Integration, this parameter-level clarification happens &lt;span class="highlight-text">closer to specific task execution&lt;/span>. The LLM needs access to &lt;span class="knowledge-type">task-specific data requirements&lt;/span>. RAG is extremely valuable here for dynamically fetching these parameter requirements or even providing valid options for an entity if needed. This could also be managed by a &lt;span class="highlight-text">standalone disambiguation module&lt;/span> with access to this granular knowledge or by logic embedded closer to the specific task handler.
So, you can see there's a logical flow: we first try to understand the broad intent. If that's unclear, we clarify it. Once the intent is reasonably clear, if details are still missing for that specific intent, we then prompt for those specifics. This hierarchical approach ensures we're guiding the user effectively.

(Optional, if you want to briefly touch on the other types):
"We also identify 'Multiple Issues in Single Messages' (5%) which we handle by decomposing the query, and 'Out of Scope Requests' (2%) which are typically met with a polite refusal. But our core focus for this disambiguation feature is tackling those top two categories effectively."

Understanding this distinction in handling different ambiguity types, their hierarchical nature (intent first, then details), and the different contextual knowledge they require (intent taxonomy vs. specific domain/entity details) is absolutely key. This directly informs our next discussion on where these disambiguation capabilities should be architecturally placed within PayPal's multi-agent system to ensure they are both effective and maintainable."
