"Good morning/afternoon, everyone. 

Today, I want to talk about a significant challenge and a corresponding opportunity within our PayPal Assistant, or PPA: Ambiguity in user queries.


So, what's the challenge? (Point to "The Challenge" section)
Contextually, our customers often use efficient but imprecise or ambiguous terms when interacting with PPA. 

Our internal analysis has surfaced a key insight: as you can see on the slide (point to the "30%" and "Opportunity Size Estimate" areas), we estimate that around 30% of all queries PPA currently receives are ambiguous. This is a substantial portion of our interactions.


The core problem is that natural language is inherently ambiguous. This leads to several consequences when PPA misinterprets these queries:

- It causes Customer Frustration when they don't get the help they need.
- It Erodes Trust in PPA's ability to assist them effectively.
- And importantly, it leads to Increased Agent Transfers, which impacts both our customer experience and operational efficiency.

Let's look at a quick example. (Point to "Wrong assumptions leading to agent transfer")
A user might say something vague like 'Reward.' PPA, making an assumption, might talk about PayPal Honey. If the user actually meant an issue with a referral reward, like 'I invited a friend and haven't received my reward,' the initial response is unhelpful, and this often leads to the user asking for a human agent.

Now, what's the Opportunity Size if we can tackle this? (Point to the diagram on the right)
Our data shows that ambiguous queries significantly increase agent transfer ratesâ€”you can see the difference here, 26.9% for ambiguous queries versus 19.8% for those without ambiguity.
Based on our analysis of total conversations, we estimate that:

A minimum of about 6% of total direct transfers are caused by ambiguity.
And more broadly, up to 32% of total conversations could benefit from better disambiguation, leading to improved resolution and user experience.
Even in the 'Not Transferred' segment for ambiguous queries (the 5.83M), there's a hidden opportunity. Just because a user didn't transfer doesn't mean they were satisfied. Better clarity here can reduce frustration, unresolved issues, and repeat contacts.

This clearly shows that addressing ambiguity isn't just a minor tweak; it's a significant lever for improving both customer satisfaction and our operational metrics. That's why we're focusing on a dedicated disambiguation feature."
