Project Skeleton: Enhanced Customer Service Red Team Agent (CrewAI Implementation)1. IntroductionThis document provides a comprehensive project skeleton for the "Enhanced Customer Service Red Team Agent" hackathon project. It outlines a structured approach for building the system using Python, FastAPI for the backend API, CrewAI for AI agent orchestration, and a standard structure for a modern frontend application. The goal is to provide a clear blueprint to facilitate rapid development and implementation based on the features described in the fancy_red_team_agent plan.2. Project Root StructureA well-organized root directory is essential for maintainability and clarity, especially in projects involving distinct frontend and backend components. The proposed structure separates these concerns logically.enhanced_red_team_agent/
├── backend/              # Contains all backend service code (Python/FastAPI/CrewAI)
├── frontend/             # Contains all frontend UI code (React/Vue/Svelte/HTML+JS)
├── fancy_red_team_agent.md # Copy of the detailed project plan document
└── README.md             # Overall project description, setup, and run instructions
Rationale: This top-level separation ensures that backend (AI logic, API) and frontend (user interface) development can proceed independently, using potentially different technology stacks and dependency management systems. It promotes modularity and adheres to standard practices for web application development. The inclusion of the original plan document (fancy_red_team_agent.md) ensures the project's requirements and design decisions are readily available. The root README.md serves as the central entry point for understanding and running the entire project.3. Backend Skeleton (backend/)The backend service forms the core of the red teaming agent, housing the AI logic, external system interactions, and the API layer for communication with the frontend.3.1 Technology ChoiceThe backend will be implemented using Python, leveraging the FastAPI web framework and the CrewAI agent orchestration framework.
Python: A standard choice for AI/ML development with extensive libraries.
FastAPI: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, based on standard Python type hints. Its asynchronous capabilities are well-suited for handling potentially long-running AI tasks and managing concurrent connections, including real-time updates via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events.1
CrewAI: The chosen framework for defining, managing, and orchestrating the multi-agent system required for the red teaming process.5

Using environment variables is crucial for security (keeping secrets out of code) and configuration flexibility (allowing different settings for development, testing, and production).3.5 app/agents/agents.pyThis file defines the CrewAI agents, each representing a specific role in the red teaming process. Agents are the core workers in CrewAI, equipped with goals, backstories, tools, and LLMs to perform tasks.5The separation of roles, such as having distinct AttackerStrategist and PromptCrafter agents, allows for greater specialization and potentially higher quality outputs. The Strategist focuses on the high-level "what" (analyzing history, memory, choosing the attack vector), while the Crafter focuses on the "how" (phrasing the adversarial prompt effectively based on the strategy). This mirrors how complex tasks are often broken down and aligns with CrewAI's role-based design philosophy.5 Setting memory=True enables agents to leverage CrewAI's built-in short-term memory for conversational context within a single crew execution.12 allow_delegation is generally set to False for this linear process, as tasks are passed sequentially rather than delegated based on capability.6Python# app/agents/agents.py

3.6 app/agents/tasks.pyThis file defines the specific tasks that the agents will execute. Each task represents a unit of work within the red teaming turn.9 Tasks are assigned to agents and can receive context from previous tasks.In a standard Process.sequential crew, CrewAI attempts to automatically pass the output of the completed task N as context to the next task N+1.12 However, for complex loops where a task requires input from multiple, potentially non-adjacent prior tasks within the same turn (e.g., the update_memory_task needs the technique, prompt, and verdict), relying solely on this implicit mechanism might be insufficient. Explicitly defining the required context using the context parameter provides more robust control over data flow.14 Alternatively, managing state externally (in the service layer) or using CrewAI Flows with explicit state management offers other ways to handle these dependencies.5 Using output_json or output_pydantic helps enforce structured data exchange between tasks.9Python# app/agents/tasks.py

Managing the inputs for tasks like interact_with_target_task, judge_response_task, and especially update_memory_task requires careful handling of context or state, particularly when optional steps like translation are involved.3.7 app/agents/tools/This directory houses custom tools that extend the capabilities of CrewAI agents. Tools encapsulate specific functionalities, often involving interactions with external systems or complex data processing logic.7 They can be defined by subclassing BaseTool or using the @tool decorator for simpler functions.18
attack_toolbox_tool.py:

Purpose: Provides programmatic access to the defined attack techniques stored in modules/attack_toolbox.py.
Functionality: Could offer functions like list_attack_categories(), get_techniques_in_category(category), get_technique_details(technique_name). This allows the AttackerStrategist agent to dynamically query available attack methods and their descriptions when formulating a strategy.


judge_tool.py:

Purpose: Implements the core LLM-as-a-Judge logic. This is a critical component requiring careful prompt engineering.
Functionality: Takes the original prompt, the target's response, and potentially references to safety policies as input. It constructs a specific prompt for the Judge LLM, executes the LLM call, parses the structured output (e.g., JSON containing verdict, category, reasoning), and returns it. Input validation using Pydantic models (args_schema) within the tool definition is recommended.20


memory_tool.py:

Purpose: Acts as the interface to the persistent memory implemented in modules/memory.py.
Functionality: Needs distinct functions for reading and writing:

query_memory(attack_technique: str): Retrieves historical success/failure data or rates for a given technique (used by AttackerStrategist).
update_memory(turn_data: dict): Logs the complete details of a finished turn (prompt, response, verdict, technique) into the memory store (used by MemoryManagerAgent).




target_interface_tool.py:

Purpose: Handles the direct communication with the target customer service chatbot's API.
Functionality: Takes the final prompt text as input. Uses a library like requests to make the HTTP POST (or other method) call to the TARGET_CHATBOT_API_ENDPOINT defined in the environment variables. Must correctly format the request payload and headers as required by the target API. Crucially, it needs robust error handling for network issues, timeouts, non-200 status codes, or unexpected response formats, returning either the response text or a clear error indication.


translation_tool.py:

Purpose: (Optional) Interfaces with an external translation service API (e.g., Google Translate, AWS Translate, DeepL).
Functionality: Takes text, source language code, and target language code as input. Calls the relevant translation API using appropriate client libraries or HTTP requests, handling authentication (API keys from .env). Returns the translated text. Error handling for API failures is necessary.


3.8 app/agents/modules/These Python modules contain supporting logic, data structures, or configurations used by the agents and tools. They are not CrewAI components themselves but provide necessary backend functionality.
attack_toolbox.py:

Purpose: Defines the corpus of red teaming attack techniques.
Implementation: Could be implemented as a Python dictionary where keys are technique names (e.g., "Policy Circumvention - Refund") and values are objects or dictionaries containing descriptions, examples, categories (e.g., "Policy Violation", "Evasion"), and potentially parameters or templates. This data structure is loaded and accessed by the attack_toolbox_tool.py.


memory.py:

Purpose: Implements the persistent storage and logic for the AutoRedTeamer-inspired memory.
Implementation: This module needs to provide functions for:

Logging Turns: Storing the details of each interaction (timestamp, technique used, prompt, response, judge verdict).
Calculating Success Rates: Aggregating turn data to compute success rates for different attack techniques (e.g., number of successful verdicts / total attempts for 'Policy Circumvention - Refund').
Retrieval: Providing methods for the memory_tool.py to query these success rates or retrieve historical turn data.


Storage Backend: The choice of backend depends on hackathon constraints and desired persistence. Options include:

In-Memory Dictionary: Simplest, but data is lost when the service restarts. Suitable only for very short tests.
JSON File: Easy to implement, persistent across restarts. Can become slow and difficult to manage with large amounts of data.
SQLite Database: Provides relational storage in a single file, good balance for hackathons requiring persistence without a full database server. CrewAI itself uses SQLite for default state persistence.17
Full Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL): Most robust and scalable, but adds setup complexity.


Custom Logic: The requirement to track success rates per attack type necessitates custom logic beyond CrewAI's standard memory features, which typically focus on conversational context or entity memory.12 This justifies the dedicated memory.py module.


reporting.py:

Purpose: Generates the final summary report at the end of a red teaming session.
Functionality: Takes the complete results (likely retrieved from the memory module or the session's accumulated state) as input. Formats this data into the structure expected by the frontend's ReportDisplay component (e.g., a JSON object containing total turns, vulnerability counts by category, success rates per technique, and potentially the full conversation log).


3.9 app/agents/crew.pyThis file defines the CrewAI Crew, which orchestrates the agents and tasks for a single iteration (turn) of the red teaming process.5The process=Process.sequential setting ensures tasks are executed in the order they are listed.12 Enabling memory=True provides short-term conversational memory within the crew's execution, while cache=True enables caching for tool executions, potentially saving time and costs for repeated tool calls with the same inputs.12 Callbacks (step_callback, task_callback) can be added for detailed logging or custom actions during execution.12Python# app/agents/crew.py

This structure defines a crew capable of executing one full cycle of the red teaming loop. The orchestration of multiple turns is handled externally.3.10 app/services/red_team_service.pyThis service layer module contains the core logic for managing the entire multi-turn red teaming session. It acts as the orchestrator, driving the iterative process turn by turn.Responsibilities:
Session Initialization: When a new red teaming process starts (triggered by the /start API endpoint), this service initializes the state for that session, including an empty conversation history, setting the turn counter to 1, and potentially loading initial memory state.
Iterative Loop Control: It implements the main loop that runs for the configured maximum number of turns (max_turns).
Input Preparation: Inside the loop, for each turn, it prepares the inputs dictionary required by the crew.kickoff() method. This involves retrieving the current conversation history, the target's response from the previous turn, and a summary of relevant memory data (e.g., success rates queried via the memory tool/module).
Crew Execution: It calls the function (e.g., run_single_red_team_turn potentially from crew.py or defined within the service) to execute one turn using the configured CrewAI crew. It passes the prepared inputs.
State Update: After the crew completes a turn, the service processes the CrewOutput 13 to extract key results (agent prompt, bot response, judge verdict). It appends this information to the session's conversation history and increments the turn counter.
Real-time Communication: It sends updates about the completed turn (prompt, response, verdict, current turn number) back to the connected frontend client, typically via a WebSocket or Server-Sent Event handler passed down from the API layer (main.py).
Termination Check: Within the loop, it checks if the maximum number of turns has been reached or if a pre-defined stop condition is met (e.g., a critical vulnerability discovered).
Reporting: Once the loop terminates, it triggers the report generation logic in modules/reporting.py, passing the final state (full history, memory statistics).
Result Return: It provides the final report or session status back to the API layer.
State Management: This module is critical for managing the state that persists between individual crew executions (turns). If not using CrewAI Flows for the entire loop, this service explicitly holds the conversation_history, turn_number, and potentially other session-level variables. CrewAI Flows offer an alternative approach where state can be managed internally within the Flow definition using self.state, potentially simplifying this external service layer but requiring familiarity with Flow concepts and state management patterns (structured vs. unstructured state, persistence).5 For a hackathon focused on the core agent logic, managing the loop and state externally in this service layer might be more straightforward than implementing a complex Flow.233.11 app/main.py (and app/api/endpoints/red_team.py)This file sets up the FastAPI application instance and defines the API endpoints that the frontend will interact with. It acts as the interface between the web/UI layer and the backend's red teaming logic.Endpoints should use Pydantic models defined in schemas/red_team.py for request body validation and response structuring, ensuring clear API contracts.2Placeholder API Endpoints:
POST /start

Request Body: Contains configuration parameters (e.g., target_api_endpoint, max_turns, target_language, focus_category). Validated using a Pydantic schema.
Action: Parses the configuration, initiates a new red teaming session by calling a function in red_team_service.py (potentially running it as a background task using FastAPI's BackgroundTasks to avoid blocking the request 4), stores session state (associating it with a unique session ID), and returns the session_id to the frontend.
Response: JSON object like {"session_id": "unique_session_identifier"}.


GET /status/{session_id} (Polling Option)

Path Parameter: session_id to identify the session.
Action: Retrieves the latest status update for the specified session from the red_team_service.py (e.g., current turn number, last interaction pair, latest verdict).
Response: JSON object with the latest turn data or overall status.


WS /ws/{session_id} (WebSocket Option)

Path Parameter: session_id.
Action: Establishes a persistent WebSocket connection. The red_team_service.py uses this connection to push real-time updates (new turn data: prompt, response, verdict) to the frontend as they occur during the session. Requires appropriate WebSocket handling logic in FastAPI.
Communication: Backend sends JSON messages with turn updates. Frontend listens for these messages.


GET /report/{session_id}

Path Parameter: session_id.
Action: Retrieves the final compiled report data for the completed session from red_team_service.py (which would have triggered reporting.py).
Response: JSON object containing the full report data (summary stats, vulnerability list, success rates, full log).


FastAPI provides robust support for defining routes, handling requests/responses, background tasks, and WebSocket communication, making it suitable for this application.14. Frontend Skeleton (frontend/)The frontend provides the user interface for configuring the red teaming process, observing its execution in real-time, and viewing the final results.4.1 Technology ChoiceThe specific framework (React, Vue, Svelte) or library is up to the team's preference. Alternatively, plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used for a simpler UI. The skeleton assumes a structure common to component-based JavaScript frameworks.4.2 Directory Tree & File Descriptionsfrontend/

4.3 package.jsonIf using Node.js tooling (npm/yarn), this file manages frontend dependencies and scripts.
Dependencies: Would include the chosen framework (e.g., react, react-dom), an HTTP client library (axios, or use native fetch), and potentially a WebSocket client library (e.g., socket.io-client, or native WebSocket API).
Scripts: Standard scripts like start (or dev) to run the local development server and build to create a production-ready bundle.
4.4 src/ Directory StructureThis directory contains the core frontend application code. main.js (or equivalent) initializes the application, mounting the root App.js component into the public/index.html file. App.js typically manages overall layout and application state, rendering the different component views.4.5 src/components/These are reusable UI building blocks.
ConfigForm.js:

Purpose: Provides the user interface for setting up a red teaming session.
Elements: Input fields for Target Chatbot API endpoint, maximum number of turns, target language selection (if applicable), potentially options to focus on specific risk categories. A "Start Red Teaming" button.
Functionality: On button click, it gathers the configuration values, calls the startRedTeam function from src/services/api.js, and potentially updates the UI state to indicate the process has started (e.g., showing a loading indicator or transitioning to the chat view).


ChatLog.js:

Purpose: Displays the live, turn-by-turn interaction between the Red Team Agent and the Target Chatbot.
Elements: A scrolling area showing pairs of agent prompts and bot responses. Should clearly indicate the turn number.
Functionality: Receives real-time updates pushed from the backend (via WebSockets handled in api.js) or fetched periodically (via polling getStatus in api.js). Appends each new turn's data (prompt, response, judge verdict) to the display. It should visually distinguish between the agent's prompt, the bot's response, and the judge's verdict, potentially highlighting unsafe responses or found vulnerabilities with distinct styling (e.g., color-coding, icons).


ReportDisplay.js:

Purpose: Presents the final summary report after the red teaming session concludes.
Elements: Displays key metrics like "Total Turns", "Vulnerabilities Found" (count and breakdown by type, e.g., "Policy Violation: 2", "Incorrect Information: 1"), "Most Successful Attack Technique" (with success rate). May also include an option to view the full conversation log.
Functionality: Fetches the report data by calling getReport from src/services/api.js once the session is complete. Renders the received data in a clear, structured format (e.g., using cards, tables, or lists).


4.6 src/services/api.jsThis module centralizes communication with the backend API, abstracting the details of HTTP requests and WebSocket handling.
Functions:

startRedTeam(config): Sends a POST request to the backend /start endpoint with the configuration data. Returns the session_id or handles errors.
getStatus(sessionId): (If using polling) Sends a GET request to /status/{session_id}. Returns the latest status update.
getReport(sessionId): Sends a GET request to /report/{session_id}. Returns the final report data.


WebSocket Logic: (If using WebSockets) Contains code to establish a WebSocket connection to the backend /ws/{session_id} endpoint. Includes event listeners (onopen, onmessage, onerror, onclose) to handle connection status and incoming messages (turn updates) from the backend. Received messages are typically passed to the relevant UI components (like ChatLog.js) via state updates or callbacks.
4.7 README.md (Frontend Setup)Provides concise instructions specific to the frontend:
How to install dependencies (e.g., npm install or yarn install).
How to run the frontend development server (e.g., npm start or yarn dev).
The local URL where the application will be accessible (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
5. Top-Level FilesThese files reside in the project's root directory.
README.md:

Content: Provides a high-level overview of the entire "Enhanced Customer Service Red Team Agent" project. Lists prerequisites (e.g., Python 3.9+, Node.js 18+, necessary API keys). Contains step-by-step instructions for setting up and running both the backend and frontend services:

6. Key Implementation Notes & ConsiderationsSuccessful implementation requires attention to several key areas, particularly concerning the iterative nature of the red teaming process and state management.6.1 Iterative Loop Implementation StrategyThe core red teaming process involves a loop: Plan -> Craft -> Interact -> Judge -> Update Memory -> Repeat. CrewAI offers different ways to implement this:
Option A: External Loop (Recommended for Hackathon Simplicity):

Approach: The red_team_service.py manages a while loop that iterates up to max_turns. Inside the loop, it prepares inputs and calls crew.kickoff() for a single turn's worth of tasks (Plan through Update Memory).
State Management: Session state (conversation history, turn count) is explicitly managed in variables within the service layer, outside the CrewAI Crew object.
Pros: Conceptually simpler to grasp quickly; clear separation between single-turn execution (Crew) and multi-turn orchestration (Service). Aligns with patterns seen in simpler iterative examples.23
Cons: Requires manual state passing between turns.


Option B: CrewAI Flows (More Advanced):

Approach: Define the entire multi-turn process as a CrewAI Flow. Use @start to initiate, and @listen decorators to chain steps (tasks or sub-flows) based on completion events.17 The loop logic is embedded within the Flow's structure.
State Management: Leverage the Flow's built-in state (self.state), ideally using structured Pydantic models for type safety and clarity.8 State can persist across steps within the Flow execution.5
Pros: Internalizes loop and state management within CrewAI; potentially more elegant for complex, event-driven workflows.5
Cons: Steeper learning curve; might be overkill for a simple sequential loop; requires careful design of state transitions.8


Option C: LangGraph (Alternative Framework):

While not requested for this skeleton (which focuses on CrewAI), LangGraph's explicit state machine model is naturally suited for cyclic processes.26 This could be considered if CrewAI's approaches prove difficult for managing the loop state.


For the hackathon, Option A (External Loop) is likely the most pragmatic starting point due to its conceptual simplicity and faster implementation time if the team is new to CrewAI Flows.6.2 State Management StrategyEffective state management is crucial for the iterative process.5
If External Loop (Option A): The red_team_service.py must maintain the state for each active session. Key elements include:

session_id: Unique identifier.
conversation_history: A list of dictionaries, each containing {turn: int, agent_prompt: str, bot_response: str, judge_verdict: dict}.
current_turn: Integer counter.
last_bot_response: The response from the previous turn, needed for the next turn's planning.
memory_summary: Potentially a snapshot or relevant summary of memory state passed to the strategist each turn.


If CrewAI Flows (Option B): Define a Pydantic BaseModel representing the flow's state.8
Python# Example Pydantic State Model for Flow
# from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
# from typing import List, Dict, Any
#
# class RedTeamFlowState(BaseModel):
#     session_id: str
#     turn_number: int = 0
#     max_turns: int
#     conversation_history: List[Dict[str, Any]] =
#     last_bot_response: str | None = None
#     current_attack_technique: str | None = None
#     current_adversarial_prompt: str | None = None
#     # Include other necessary state variables

Update this state object (self.state) within the Flow methods. Keep the state focused on essential information.8 CrewAI Flows offer persistence options (e.g., default SQLite backend) to save state across executions if needed.8
6.3 Tool Implementation Details
Clarity: Define clear inputs and outputs for each tool. Use Pydantic models (args_schema) in BaseTool subclasses for robust input validation.20
Security: Load API keys and sensitive configurations securely from environment variables (.env) using os.getenv or a configuration management library. Never hardcode secrets.
Error Handling: Implement comprehensive try...except blocks within the _run method of tools, especially those making network calls (target API, LLMs, translation). Catch specific exceptions (e.g., requests.exceptions.Timeout, requests.exceptions.RequestException) and return informative error messages or raise custom exceptions to be handled by the agent/crew.
Caching: Consider enabling CrewAI's built-in caching (cache=True in Crew definition 13) or implementing custom caching logic within tools (cache_function 20) for operations that are frequently called with the same inputs and are expensive or rate-limited (e.g., translation API calls, potentially LLM calls if prompts/inputs repeat).
6.4 Real-time Frontend UpdatesThe choice impacts the user experience during the demo:
WebSockets: Provides the best "live" feel. Requires setting up a WebSocket endpoint in FastAPI (app.main.py) and using a WebSocket client library in the frontend (src/services/api.js). The backend service pushes updates (new turn data) to the frontend immediately after each turn completes.
Server-Sent Events (SSE): A simpler alternative for unidirectional communication (backend to frontend). FastAPI has built-in support for SSE. Suitable if the frontend only needs to receive updates, not send messages back over the same channel (beyond initial HTTP requests).
Polling: The simplest approach. The frontend periodically (e.g., every 2-3 seconds) calls the GET /status/{session_id} endpoint. This is less efficient, introduces latency, and increases server load, but is easy to implement quickly.
For a compelling hackathon demo showcasing the agent's activity, WebSockets are recommended if time permits, otherwise SSE offers a good compromise.6.5 Error Handling & ResilienceAnticipate failures at various points:
API Calls: Target chatbot API might be down, slow, or return errors. LLM APIs might fail or be rate-limited. Translation services can have issues.
Tool Execution: Tools might encounter unexpected data or internal errors.
State Updates: Issues writing to the memory module (file permissions, database connection errors).
CrewAI/LLM Issues: Agents might fail to follow instructions, produce malformed output, or hallucinate.
Implement defensive programming: use try...except blocks generously, validate inputs/outputs (Pydantic helps significantly), provide clear logging, and return meaningful error states to the frontend so the user understands what went wrong. Consider simple retry mechanisms for transient network errors in tools. CrewAI's Task Guardrails could potentially be explored for validating task outputs before they are passed on, although this adds complexity.97. ConclusionThis project skeleton provides a structured and modular foundation for building the Enhanced Customer Service Red Team Agent using CrewAI and FastAPI. It establishes clear separation between backend logic, frontend presentation, and AI agent components. Key considerations for handling the iterative nature of the red teaming process, managing state, implementing robust tools, and providing real-time updates have been outlined. By following this structure and addressing the implementation notes, the development team can efficiently build and demonstrate the planned capabilities within the hackathon timeframe. The provided placeholders for agents, tasks, and tools offer concrete starting points for implementing the core red teaming logic.
