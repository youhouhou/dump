So, to close this gap between testing and reality, we built the AI ChatLab. Our mission is to help teams stop relying on slow manual testing, and start simulating real user behavior at scale with AI agent.

Our framework is built on two core systems that work together

<!-- First, a multi-agent User Simulation system. This system uses a team of agents to analyze real failure logs and create a 'Living Persona'—a simulated user with the same goals, frustrations, and communication style as the original human. This isn't a rigid script; it's an adaptive simulation that reacts to our target agent in real-time. -->

First, our multi-agent User Simulation system.
It analyzes real failure logs to automatically build a 'Living Persona.' this isn't a rigid script—it's an adaptive simulation that reacts to our target agent in real-time

And second, our Multi-Dimensional Evaluation system. Instead of a simple pass/fail, our 'judge' agent generates a full diagnostic report. It analyzes what the agent understood versus what it missed, and provides clear, actionable Improvement Suggestions.
