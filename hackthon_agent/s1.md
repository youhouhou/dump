Good morning. A key challenge for all of us is preparing our agents for real-world conversations.

<!-- This interaction shows here is a example of that challenge.  -->
These kinds of conversational turns are very hard to test for with our current setups.

The real issue isn't about getting one answer right. It’s about handling the context and intent that changes throughout a conversation.

Our standard tests often use simple scripts and check single queries. They don't fully prepare agents for this kind of complex, back-and-forth dialogue.

This shared challenge is what inspired our project. We wanted to build a tool to help us all better prepare our agents for real customers.
