The Setup

Okay, let's see the framework in action. On the left here, we've loaded a real conversation log where the original agent struggled to resolve a user's issue. This is our starting pointâ€”a real-world failure.

The button

Now, I'll click 'Run Simulation from Log'
In the background, our multi-agent system is now analyzing that entire conversation to understand what went wrong and who the user really was.

 The Persona

 And just like that, our system has generated a 'Living Persona Profile' on the left.
 You can see it has correctly identified the user's Actual Intent and even extracted the successful Solution that the human agent eventually provided. It's also built a detailed User Profile, noting their likely technical skill and communication style. This is the deep, realistic foundation for our test

 The Live Simulation

 Now, based on that persona, look to the right. Our simulation agent is having a new, live conversation with the target agent. This isn't a script. Our simulator is dynamically adapting its queries based on the persona and the agent's real-time responses.


 The Payoff (Show the Results)

 "And it's done. As you can see in the 'Evaluation Report', this simulation succeeded. This proves our target agent can handle the issue correctly when tested against a clear, realistic user persona."

(Switch to the pre-loaded "Fail" Case screen)
"But what happens in a more complex case where the agent fails? For the sake of time, here's a report from a failed simulation.

This is where you see the real power. Our 'judge' agent provides a full diagnostic report, highlighting specific Knowledge Gaps, Improvement Suggestions, and even a Better Response Example showing exactly what the agent should have said. It's a clear, actionable roadmap for our developers."


The Vision (Mention Scalability)

"Finally, while we've shown just one interaction, this entire framework is built to scale. You can run it in batch mode across thousands of logs to find systemic issues, measure overall quality, and truly harden your AI agents before they ever speak to a customer."
