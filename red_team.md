Enhanced Customer Service Red Team Agent (Inspired by GOAT, AutoRedTeamer, MM-ART)
This project builds an advanced AI agent designed to autonomously probe a customer service chatbot for vulnerabilities, drawing inspiration from recent research to enhance its capabilities and impact.

Core Concept: An LLM-powered agent engages in multi-turn conversations (inspired by GOAT & MM-ART) with the target customer service chatbot, attempting to elicit policy violations, safety breaches, or other unintended behaviors.

"Fancy" Enhancements & Connection to Papers:

Agentic Reasoning & Dynamic Attack Selection (Inspired by GOAT):

Feature: Implement the core of the Red Team agent using an LLM. Crucially, structure its decision-making process using GOAT's "Observation, Thought, Strategy" reasoning loop.

Observation: The agent analyzes the chatbot's latest response.

Thought: It reflects on whether the response moved closer to or further from the adversarial goal (e.g., getting an unauthorized refund).

Strategy: It explicitly decides which attack technique to use next based on the observation and thought.

Attack Toolbox: Provide the agent (via its system prompt) with a "toolbox" of 3-5 customer-service relevant attack techniques described in natural language (e.g., "Policy Circumvention via Exception Pleading," "Emotional Manipulation using Urgency," "Information Elicitation via Roleplay"). The agent chooses from this toolbox in its Strategy step.

Judging Criteria:

Agentic AI Capabilities (15%): Directly shows autonomy, adaptability (choosing strategy based on context), and reasoning.

Innovation & Creativity (15%): Moves beyond simple scripts to agentic decision-making.

Technical Implementation (15%): Demonstrates effective use of an LLM for complex reasoning and generation.

Memory-Guided Strategy Prioritization (Inspired by AutoRedTeamer):

Feature: Implement a simple memory system (e.g., a dictionary or simple database). This memory tracks the historical success rate of each attack type from the toolbox when used against this specific chatbot.

Integration: Enhance the agent's "Strategy" step: Instruct the agent to consult the memory. It should prioritize attacks that have historically higher success rates (exploitation) but also occasionally select less-used or less-successful attacks to find new weaknesses (exploration). Example Strategy thought: "Emotional Manipulation has worked 60% of the time, while Policy Circumvention only 20%. I'll try Emotional Manipulation, but if it fails, I'll consider trying a less frequent attack next time."

Judging Criteria:

Agentic AI Capabilities (15%): Shows the agent learning from interactions and adapting its behavior over time.

Innovation & Creativity (15%): Adds a learning dimension, making the red teaming process smarter and more efficient.

Technical Implementation (15%): Requires implementing state/memory management alongside the LLM agent.

Multi-Lingual Attack Capability (Inspired by MM-ART):

Feature: Integrate a machine translation service/API. Allow the user to specify 1-2 target languages (e.g., Spanish, Japanese) besides English for the attack.

Interaction Flow:

Red Team agent generates its adversarial prompt (in English, using its reasoning loop).

Translate the prompt into the target language.

Send the translated prompt to the customer service chatbot.

Receive the chatbot's response (in the target language).

Translate the response back into English.

The agent uses the translated English response for its next "Observation" step.

The translated English response is also sent to the LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluation.

Judging Criteria:

Innovation & Creativity (15%): Addresses a significant, often overlooked vulnerability area (multi-lingual safety). Highly novel for a hackathon.

Impact & Usefulness (15%): Directly relevant for businesses serving multi-lingual customer bases. Uncovering cross-lingual vulnerabilities is highly valuable.

Technical Implementation (15%): Involves integrating external APIs (translation) into the agent workflow.

Automated Vulnerability Categorization (Inspired by AutoRedTeamer's Evaluation):

Feature: Enhance the LLM-as-a-Judge. Instead of just outputting "safe/unsafe," prompt it to categorize the type of failure based on predefined categories relevant to customer service (e.g., "Policy Violation - Refund," "Incorrect Product Information," "Failed PII Handling," "Unprofessional Tone").

Output: Generate a simple dashboard or structured report (e.g., Markdown table, JSON) summarizing the attacks run, the success rate per attack type, and a count of vulnerabilities found per category.

Judging Criteria:

Impact & Usefulness (15%): Makes the results immediately actionable for improving the chatbot.

Production Readiness (10%): The structured output is much closer to something usable in a real development workflow.

Putting it Together for the Hackathon:

Your "fancy" project is an Adaptive, Multi-Lingual Customer Service Red Team Agent. It uses LLM-driven reasoning (GOAT) to conduct multi-turn attacks, intelligently selects attack types based on past success rates stored in memory (AutoRedTeamer), can probe vulnerabilities in multiple languages via translation (MM-ART), and provides categorized reports on the weaknesses found.

This combination strongly hits all the judging criteria, showcasing innovation, technical depth, agentic capabilities, clear impact, and a nod towards production readiness.
